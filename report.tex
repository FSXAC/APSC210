\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Outline}\label{introduction-outline}

This report serves to probe the progression of career development. This report is written with intent to achieve helping us gauge our current desired career path by reviewing the skills obtained throughout the work term, as well as future desired skills that would be necessary for future careers. \\
\\
The report is broken down into four parts to help us understand what is it we need to proceed in our career development: industry in current work term, current skills being obtained, desired future industry, and transferable skills that might aid us reaching there.\\
\\
The report will also briefly describe the company and the industry it takes position in. The studio that I work for is BioWare, which is a subsidiary of a larger publisher, Electronic Arts (EA).

\subsection{Scope}\label{introduction-scope}

The scope of report consists of analysis of skills and duty pertained to me and future desired skills. The report will not include details about the game, engine, or other technology used during the work term that helped me obtaining skills or reach my objectives.

\subsection{Industry}\label{introduction-industry}

EA or BioWare, like many other studios or publishers exist in the market right now  falls into the consumer entertainment industry. The products produced is associated with Microsoft and Sony as they develop the hardware the games will run on. Future industries I wish to work in consist of electronics development or robotics and control systems.\\
\\
\textit{Work Term Industry} (section \ref{work-term-industry}) provides insight the industry with which we are currently working and competing in. This section outlines the company's position and its competitions in the gaming and or online entertainment and content delivery industry.

\subsection{Company}\label{introduction-company}

BioWare is a game development studio founded in 1995 by three medical doctors in Edmonton, Alberta\cite{bioware-wiki}. Since the establishment, BioWare has developed numerous titles including the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchise as well as the massive multiplier online (MMO) game Star Wars: The Old Republic. BioWare is currently developing Anthem, the upcoming game set to release in Feburary, 2019.\\
\\
The company is now a division of EA, which is an American video game publishing company. This allows for cross-studio sharing of technology. Such as using the Frostbite engine (game engine developed by another EA studio, DICE, in Sweden) instead of using the in-house engine BioWare developed \cite{frostbite-wiki}\cite{eadice-wiki}. In 2018, BioWare went through rebranding that replaced the logos (figure \ref{fig:biowarelogos}).\cite{bioware-wiki}\\

\end{figure}

There is a pipeline of games the studio outputs, the latest one being Anthem, showcased at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2017 and 2018. The game so far has won many E3 awards.\\
\\
To date, there are 800 active employees working at BioWare ranging from artists to programmers. My position is an associate developer on the UI/UX team for the game Anthem. Mostly developing engine tools, and elements the scriptwriters and artists can then use to add feature into the game. \\

\section{Work Term Industry}\label{work-term-industry}

% Unorganized
% The "root" industry is consumer entertainment. This includes games, TV shows, movies, sports, etc. It is to be noted that even though the BioWare studio develops games, the publisher is associated with franchises in films such as Star Wars and sports such as NHL, NBA, Madden, etc.\\
% \\
% The more specific work term industry this belongs to is the ``video game industry" \cite{video-game-industry}. The industry consists of hardware development and manufacturing (such as video game consoles, controllers, computers, etc.), software (programming, servers and infrastructures), and content creation (art, videos). The following graph breaks down the roles for video game industry \cite{EA-intern-conf-2} (at least in the perspective of EA).
% end of unorganized

BioWare is computer software company that develops video games for PCs, XBOX, and PlayStation. Thus we fall under \textit{Services - Computer Programming / Software} industry. 

\subsection{Industry History}

The history of video game industry started in the 1970s when computers are powerful enough to run games even though videos exisited since the 40s. Recently, the video game industry has expanded to many platforms including social media, mobile, argumented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\cite{video-game-industry-wiki}\cite{video-game-industry-stats}\\

\subsection{Economic Status}

Earlier games in the industry are generally cheap inexpensive to make because of small teams and low demand for quality from the consumers. In recent decades however, large budget games (A.K.A AAA or Triple A games) consists of large development teams and usually takes  a year to three yeear to develop a single game. This is due to increased technological complexity.\cite{cost-game}\\
\\
In 2017, the video game industry was valued at 17.68 billion USD. \cite{video-game-industry-stats}.\\
\\
One competitor in the industry, Rockstar, and their most recent products Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) has become the most profitable product in the industry \cite{IGN-gta5}. With a total revenue of \$6 billion, it has made "more money than any film, book, or game".\\

\subsection{Geographics \& Concentrations}

The industry applies worldwide. The USA is one of the largest producer of video games, most companies and publishers including Electronic Arts, Blizzard - Activision, and Valve (they own the world's largest online video game distribution platform - Steam \cite{steam}).\\
\\
The largest market is China, with MMO games on PC being the largest category \cite{video-game-china}\cite{big-game-china}.

\subsection{Opportunities for Engineers}

\section{Desired Future Industry}\label{desired-future-industry}

% TODO: encapsulate the desired industries into items provided in the handbook

I have three options:

1. (Depth)
- Continue down the software development path on UI/UX or app development. Although drifted from area of study, could be a viable option to consolidate existing skills and experiences

Possible industries:
- Software development (Microsoft, Google, Startups)
- Video game industy (Coming back to EA or other game publishers)

Benefits:
- Already know a lot of things
- Easier integration and on boarding for future opportunities

Tradeoffs:
- The experiences and skills in this particular area snowballs: because the more experiences I have as software developer, the more likely I would get a position that is software developer in the future
- Not very hands on, sometimes could get very abstract => lss personal satisfaction.

2. (Breadth)
- Try something else to expand my set of skills to different areas.
- Include and apply knowledge more related to area of study (electronics, mechanical, controls, robotics, PCB, etc)

Possible industries:
- Electronics and hardware (Intel, etc)
- Robotics or control systems

Benefits:
- Experience new things, gain insight and additional interests
- Technical experience is not fixated on software development
- More hands on

3. (Academic or Research)
- Research positions (universites, NRC, CSA, etc.)
- Research discipline can be both computer science or research regarding electronics or control systems

Benefits:
- Research experience
- Grad school recommendations
